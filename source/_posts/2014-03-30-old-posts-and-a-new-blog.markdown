It's kind of been a while since I had a personal blog that I updated. I'm
starting again on [Octopress](http://octopress.org).

Because my previous attempt at a blog was also a static site generated from
Markdown, just not one as well-planned-out as Octopress, it was actually
straightforward to port over my old posts. That's why, below here, you'll see
some posts from 2011.
