We live in an amazing era. Anybody with a sufficient Internet connection, even
a wireless connection, can listen to nearly *any piece of music they want to*.

I dimly remember a TV commercial from the mid '90s, advertising a
telecommunications company by way of advertising the "Information
Superhighway". A weary traveler in a run-down bar in the desert asks the
bartender something like "What kind of music you got here?" The bartender
answers "Everything." The traveler asks for a particular recording of a
particular piece of classical music, and the bartender immediately puts it on.
It sounded ludicrous then. It's reality now.

The particular reason I mention this is, I've just spent about 8 months
listening to the complete works of J. S. Bach, and picking out good recordings
of all of them. This wasn't my intention at the start. At the start I just
wanted to discover more good Bach pieces, and put them into a nice deduplicated
playlist as I did so. But the funny thing is, once you listen to enough Bach,
something clicks, and *any* Bach piece has the potential to be really good.

I say "potential" because another thing I discovered is that the recording
*really* matters. For every beautiful, inspired perfomance, there are ten
performances that range from half-assed to offensive.

There are a few cases of compositions by Bach where I think nobody has made the
right recording yet. But for most of the 1,075-ish pieces in this playlist, I
was choosing from multiple great options.

Spotify is the thing that made it possible. Spotify is also the thing that made
it hard, because their organization of classical music is terrible. When I was
halfway done, I even had the misfortune of upgrading to a version of Spotify
that dumbed down the search feature, so searching became much harder until
(months later) the Spotify help forums told me about an undocumented feature to
fix it.

Spotify needs music librarians. I'm not one, but I'll play one on
the Internet. After all, I've just listened to all\* his compositions, and I want
to share with you what I found.

## The playlists

Let's get to the point now. Here's the collection. It's broken into six
playlists to provide a bit of relief to your scrolling fingers. The fact that
every\* Bach piece is catalogued with a BWV number, and the BWV numbers are
approximately broken up by what style of work they are, is quite helpful here.
I'll link to the playlists while describing them in broad strokes:

- **[BWV 1-249][]**: Big choral works, including the cantatas and masses
    - **[BWV 1-249 unabridged][]**: the same list, including every single recitative
- **[BWV 250-524][]**: Chorales and songs (To be honest, if you listen straight
  through this playlist in particular, you're gonna have a bad time.)
- **[BWV 525-770][]**: Organ works
- **[BWV 772-994][]**: Keyboard works
- **[BWV 995-1080][]**: Works for orchestras and solo instruments
- **[BWV 1081-1128][]**: Works discovered since 1950
- A list of **[highlights][]**, my favorite 10% or so across all pieces

Why am I suggesting you listen to an "abridged" version of BWV 1-249 in a complete
Bach playlist? In that version, I skipped *some* of the particularly uninteresting
recitative movements. Every cantata is in there, just some of them get to the point
faster.

It might sound sacrilegious to suggest that Bach wrote some uninteresting
movements of cantatas, but he *did*, and I've even seen conductors writing
program notes who said the same. It's my opinion that you shouldn't force
yourself to listen to these just because you're listening to cantatas.
Cantatas are an amazing listening experience, an experience you shouldn't have
to delay while listening to someone speak-singing in German for a while just so
they can get through all the text.

I think you'd include these recitatives if you actually were performing the
music in a church service, as the cantatas originally were, but if you're just
appreciating the music, it'll work better when some of the recitatives aren't
there.

There are interesting recitatives too, and there are recitatives that are
musically important to get from one movement to the next. Those are there, even
in the abridged version. But you may disagree with my aesthetic choices, and
that's why I included the [unabridged 1-249 playlist][BWV 1-249 unabridged] as
well.

## How should you listen?

This is of course really subjective.

My recommendation is to pick a mostly arbitrary point in one of the playlists,
but this point should be at the start of a BWV number, or the start of a
collection such as the Goldberg Variations. Then listen for a while. When you
get to the end of a piece and you want to hear something different, pick a
different arbitrary point. Let's call this "manual shuffle".

These playlists won't work well to listen straight through -- if you did that,
you'd hear all the cantatas first, and all the best-known instrumental pieces
many days later. It wouldn't be a good mix.

Putting the whole folder of playlists on shuffle wouldn't be a terrible thing to do.
You'll often hear something from the middle of a work out of context that way, so
if it interests you, go back and listen to the whole work in order.

The [highlights][] playlist is easier to put on shuffle and slightly better optimized
for that purpose. But I still recommend the "manual shuffle" technique most of all.


## Searching for Bach

I'll restate that trying to find classical music on Spotify is a pretty bad
experience. There's just no consistency to how things are labeled. Classical
music doesn't fit in the hierarchy that every major music player has settled
on that attempts to describe every track by its "artist", "album", and "song",
and some ways to mitigate the problem don't exist on Spotify.

In classical music, "albums" are unpredictable and arbitrary. They're not
grouped by work, they're grouped by how much music you can fit on a CD. The
"artist" is sometimes the composer, but more often the performer, especially
when the performance is particularly good (look for the cello suites under
"Yo-Yo Ma", not "J. S. Bach").

...

## Picking the recordings

It seems that Bach, more than other composers, has motivated some performers to
plod through an uninspired performance just to get a recording out there.  The
worst offenders are the compilation albums that shovel together generic
recordings for some utilitarian purpose, with names like "Bach for Studying",
"Bach To Train Your Brain", and worst of all "Smart Babies".

Even the ones that sound well-intentioned, such as "Fifty Essential Bach
Pieces", are not going to get you the right recordings. This may sound like a
hypocritical thing for me to say when presenting an enormous Bach compilation,
but the issue here is that the compilation albums didn't license the best
performances, just the ones that were most convenient to re-release. I can put
Glenn Gould on the playlist. They can't.

I found along the way that one really *can* judge a Bach recording by its
cover.  Here's the cover of a recording from John Eliot Gardiner's "Bach
Cantata Pilgrimage", a quality series of recordings of all the sacred cantatas
that makes them sound fresh and new instead of fossilized:

![Bach Cantata Pilgrimage album cover](/images/gardiner-cover.gif)

If it looks like a National Geographic cover, that's because they got a
National Geographic photographer to make these inspiring humanist cover photos
for the whole series of albums.

Meanwhile, here's the cover from "Relax with Mozart Chopin & Bach", whose
recordings are uninspired and terribly recorded on top of that:

![A bad Bach album cover](/images/shitty-bach.gif)

Ugh. Finally, here's the cover of an album that's seriously called "Classical
music for read a books":

![A worse Bach album cover](/images/shittier-bach.gif)

Given the level of effort, you might be able to guess what that album contains:
recordings of public-domain MIDIs.

I found the cover images on Spotify to be important not just as an estimator of
quality, but also because the easiest way to tell when a track is part of a
series of related recordings is from the cover art.

After listening to enough recordings, here are the series I ended up choosing
most of the time they were options:

* Anything with Yo-Yo Ma on cello
* Glenn Gould's 1980 piano recordings
* John Eliot Gardiner / Monteverdi Choir / English Baroque Soloists, in their
  "Bach Cantata Pilgrimage"
* Masaaki Suzuki and Bach Collegium Japan, also performing cantatas
* Kevin Bowyer on organ with Det Fynske Kammerkor
* Simon Preston on organ, on recordings that aren't too ravaged by time

Besides the fact that I often preferred these performers, I looked for variety
when possible. Because Bach's music is adaptable to so many instruments, I
sometimes preferred performances that increased the variety of instruments,
such as organ preludes featuring a trumpet, or Chris Thile playing fugues on
the banjo.

I could have used Helmuth Rilling's recordings of all the chorales (BWV
250-438). Helmuth Rilling's ensemble is competent but unexciting, though, so I
included non-Rilling recordings at many opportunities, even ones whose quality
might be controversial.

Similarly, even though Gardiner and Suzuki produced excellent recordings of all
the sacred cantatas, I frequently found recordings by someone else that would
compare, so in those cases I tended to favor non-Gardiner, non-Suzuki
recordings to increase the variety.

## \*

I've been saying this is a playlist of all-with-an-asterisk Bach pieces. What's
with the asterisk?

The problem is just that "all Bach pieces" is a bit hard to define. The goal is to
have one recording of every authentic Bach piece from BWV 1 to 1128.

Some Bach pieces have been lost to history. Those tend not to have BWV numbers,
at least. But among the ones that do have BWV numbers:

* BWV 216 only survives in a fragmentary state, and no recordings of it are
  available on Spotify.
* BWV 224 is extremely fragmentary -- only 30 measures survive -- and as far as
  I can tell, those 30 measures have not been recorded anywhere.
* A number of chorales in BWV 250-438 correspond to organ arrangements in BWV
  599-644, and sometimes their best recordings put them together in the same
  track.
* Some pieces exist that *aren't* in the BWV list. At least one ensemble has
  recorded a canon that they believe goes between BWV 1077 and BWV 1078. Such
  pieces are sometimes labeled "BWV deest".
* Many pieces with BWV numbers have since been deemed to be spurious -- that
  is, not by Bach at all. I left these out in clear cases.

BWV 216 and 224 are missing from the list out of necessity. I skipped the BWV
numbers that are considered by broad consensus to be spurious, especially when
we know which other composer actually wrote it. In cases of doubt, I left the
piece in the list. And I tried to avoid duplicating tracks, so some pieces in
BWV 250-438 actually appear somewhere in BWV 599-644 in the order of the list.

So that's what the asterisk is about. The list contains over 1000 unique,
non-spurious Bach pieces (and probably some spurious ones that we just don't
know are spurious yet). And that's as close to "all" of them as you can
possibly get on Spotify.

To understand the list better, you can look at [the Google
spreadsheet][spreadsheet]

I used for keeping track of the pieces I was adding, which shows the complete
list of pieces and performers. The gray rows are the numbers left out because
they're spurious, and the purple rows are duplicates of a recording that
appears elsewhere.

## What did I find when I listened to all of Bach?

I'll be posting some follow-ups about the recordings that were particularly
interesting, and the ones that are simply too good to not listen to. For now,
follow the lists and enjoy the music.
