Unsorted notes

- BWV 8's playful arpeggios make me think of Schubert. Great oboe and flute
  playing throughout. Bach Collegium Japan is all about technical sparkle.

- Gardiner's version of BWV 62 does really cool things with the dynamics of the
  main theme. The theme is played first by a few instruments, and then by the
  whole orchestra, and Gardiner makes this effect as intense as possible. The
  first instruments to play the theme sound like a warning about what's coming,
  a warning that never fully manages to prepare you for the onslaught.

  This is the only Bach cantata on my running playlist.

- BWV 80: This performance by American Bach Soloists really brings out the
  organ, instead of hiding it in the background.

- BWV 97: The second aria has an excellent viola performance.

- BWV 147: I didn't originally know that the chorus we call "Jesu, Joy of Man's
  Desiring" is from this. Bach apparently liked it so much that he included it
  twice in the cantata, as "Wohl mir, dass ich Jesum habe" and "Jesu bleibet
  meine Freude". There are so many great recordings to choose from, but Bach
  Collegium Japan's performance is impeccable.

- BWV 170: Ton Koopman has done amazing things recently, but his older complete
  set of cantatas on Spotify is only sometimes good. But this one is very, very
  good.

  The three movements of 170 sound very different from each other. The first
  is slow and beautiful, the second is unsettling, and the last is upbeat
  with an interesting chord progression that constantly surprises you with
  where it goes.

- BWV 180: This is why I started listening to La Petite Bande's versions.

- BWV 243: The opening "Magnificat" is excellent, but don't miss the later
  movements, such as the plaintive "Et misericordia" or the intense "Omnes
  generationes".
  
  In the final vocal phrase of "Et misericordia": while Bach is
  known for being the definition of traditional music theory, I never knew
  you could resolve a bII chord like that.

## Gardiner

...

Gardiner spends a fair amount of time in the beginning of his book protesting
about the tendency for Bach's music to become fossilized. He believes ensembles
all over the world have been performing uninteresting renditions of Bach
cantatas because that's the way they've always been performed.

The particular complaint that he levels against some ensembles (calling them
out by name) is that they aim for "loveliness" above all else. He believes that
Bach can be more compelling if the performers are willing to be bold and break
some traditions. To find exciting moments in the piece and, instead of
smoothing over them with traditional "loveliness", stick them *right in the
listener's face* and make them think about what they're hearing. This is the
goal that he's set for himself.

As an example, here's Helmuth Rilling's ensemble, performing the opening chorus
of BWV 62 in a perfectly nice, traditional, bland way. Listen to at least the
first 15 seconds or so, or a minute and a half if you want a better comparison:

[Rilling BWV 62]

And now here's Gardiner's version:

[Gardiner BWV 62]

See? *Right in the face.*

I love this version. It's the only Bach cantata that's also on my running playlist.

Listen to Gardiner's BWV 225, "Singet dem Herrn", as well. He really puts the
"zing" in "Singet", and I mean that both literally and figuratively. He says
that the pure energy of singing this piece is what inspired him to go forward
with the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage.
