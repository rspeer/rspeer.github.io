<div class="entry-content"><p>BAPHL 4 was, of course, the largest puzzle hunt I&rsquo;ve been involved in creating,
and the first where I&rsquo;ve ended up in charge of making the event happen. It
seems to have gone very well.</p>

<p>The hunt would not have been nearly as good without our hordes of testsolvers,
especially the three whole teams that Charles rounded up.  They caught lots of
mistakes, and lots of puzzles that were unreasonably hard.  We spent much of
the last week before the hunt cutting puzzles down to size wherever we could,
and yet the three teams took 8 to 11 hours to solve the Normal Mode (admittedly
with distractions), prompting us to cut even more.</p>

<p>There were a few cases where we did this by replacing a Hard Mode puzzle with a
thoroughly-testsolved Normal Mode puzzle, which means that for much of the
hunt, Normal Mode teams were solving the same puzzles as Hard Mode. This would
presumably be why only one of the five Normal Mode teams finished. I apologize
for that part. Normal Mode is a nice goal of BAPHL, but it&rsquo;s hard to do. It
means you have to calibrate the difficulty of each puzzle twice and testsolve
two versions of it, and already you can never have enough testsolvers.</p>

<p>On the plus side, the difficulty ended up being a reasonable challenge for the
24 Hard Mode teams, with the winners finishing in 3 hours, and with at least 14
of them finishing within the total 7 hours.</p>

<p>The puzzles, in the form that we distributed to people, can be found on
<a href="http://baphl.org/4/puzzles.html">the BAPHL 4 page</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my behind-the-scenes comments on the individual puzzles. (These have
substantial spoilers, if you were planning to try the puzzles.)</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Round 1</h2>

<h3>E-Z Does It (Adam Hesterberg, substantially modified by me)</h3>

<p>This puzzle started as a much longer puzzle named &ldquo;Easy Enigma&rdquo;, where the
answers to a bunch of clues would turn out to start with two letter sounds. I
shortened it, especially because I wanted a puzzle there that was truly easy so
teams could unlock round 2.</p>

<p>For a while, its title was &ldquo;Easy Does It&rdquo;, but many testsolvers were still not
finding it easy, so finally we changed the title to the one that hits you over
the head with the mechanism.</p>

<h3>Beginnings and Ends (Bryce Herdt)</h3>

<p>We were worried about this puzzle&rsquo;s difficulty for a while. We had
testsolved several versions of it that seemed to be just a bit too hard for
BAPHL, having clues that were unordered within each line, as well as harder
clues such as &ldquo;Silly person&rdquo; cluing GOOFBALL. But we got the puzzle into a
reasonably finished state several days before the hunt.</p>

<h3>Bit by Bit (Amos Eshel)</h3>

<p>We had a <em>very</em> hard time getting the difficulty right on this one. We must
have gone through at least 10 versions of the puzzle, oscillating between far
too hard and far too easy. We were still worried about the hard version on
Thursday night, and getting it testsolved (by a non-native speaker of English,
who found it very hard and time-consuming) was only slightly reassuring. And
yet in the hunt it worked out fine.</p>

<h3>The Chase (Catherine Havasi and me)</h3>

<p>This was our least-testsolved puzzle, because it required being on site. The
major glitch was that the clue to look for &ldquo;the lightning man&rdquo; in the Harvard
Bookstore, which was supposed to lead you to a biography of Samuel Morse,
simply didn&rsquo;t work. Some teams didn&rsquo;t encounter the problem because they had
already solved the puzzle by that point &mdash; but those are the stronger teams. So
this puzzle had an unfortunate flaw that only slowed down the teams who were
already behind.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, once teams had the clue to use Morse code, they would
likely look at the Morse code chart in the intro packet, where I had mistyped
the code for the letter U.</p>

<p>We had tried to actually order a copy of The Lightning Man and get the Harvard
Bookstore to put it in their window, but they brushed us off. I tried and
failed to find another nearby way to clue Morse.  Finally, I just had the
instruction point people to the catalog computer in the Harvard Bookstore. I
checked that the computer would give you the book if you searched for
&ldquo;lightning man&rdquo;. I checked again on their website, which I thought used the
same catalog, on Friday. In the 15 minutes I had to spare on Saturday morning,
I checked most of the route again, but I skipped the end, knowing that most of
its clues were literally carved in stone. But that meant I also skipped the
bookstore.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s why, if you used the Harvard Bookstore&rsquo;s catalog in person on
Saturday, you turned out to get some unrelated book. It&rsquo;s a law of the
Universe: the one part of your puzzle you don&rsquo;t check will be dead wrong.</p>

<h3>Totem (Jason Alonso and me)</h3>

<p>Being the final metapuzzle, this puzzle was written and testsolved
approximately five months ago. We made one change to it since then, which was
to add the L to the middle hex of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Originally, we intended for the radii of the hexagon to give you six-letter
combinations that give unique eight-letter words when you add letters to the
front and back, all of which happened to end in L so that they could share the
middle hex.  Testsolvers didn&rsquo;t actually have much trouble finding these. But
later, testsolvers who tried the puzzle with incomplete information tended to
try to use the L in their answer (it&rsquo;s clued <em>six times</em>, so it&rsquo;s probably
important!). So we put it in the puzzle, making it easier. Not that that&rsquo;s a
bad thing.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I clued &ldquo;ESOTERIC&rdquo; by the fact that it has an obscure anagram
(COTERIES). A bonus for Scrabble players? Pure sadism? But people seemed to be
able to deduce which word could be anagrammed anyway, which was my hope.</p>

<p>Normal-mode solvers got all the word lengths marked on their hex grid, which
for hard-mode solvers would have been a dangerous amount of information. It
enables many, many opportunities for backsolving &mdash; and in fact, one of our
normal-mode testsolving teams managed to backsolve the entire middle meta from
Totem! But I actually think that&rsquo;s a good thing to give to less experienced
teams, so they can experience the joy of backsolving.</p>

<h2>Round 2</h2>

<h3>Keeping Tabs (Sam Trabucco)</h3>

<p>Sam sprung this puzzle on me when I thought he
was going to give me a different one, and that&rsquo;s great, because I consider it
to be the most original puzzle idea in our whole hunt. It&rsquo;s elegant in an
unconventional way despite being chock full of red herrings.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really get to find out how teams reacted to it during BAPHL, but I
remember having people test-solve it in my living room while I went off to edit
more puzzles, and suddenly hearing a chorus of &ldquo;OHHHHHH&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>

<h3>Something Isn&rsquo;t Right (Charles Steinhardt)</h3>

<p>A familiar puzzle type, but one that has lots of room for variation, and which
tends to be fun both to write and to solve.  Making the puzzle was Charles&rsquo;s
idea, and we did it in the last week when we found ourselves a puzzle short,
despite that we then needed to find a whole lot of testsolvers to find false
positives in it.</p>

<p>We swapped its answer with another puzzle when we found that VIEW is really
hard to clue with five words, and its current answer can be <em>made</em> of five
words, as long as one of them is allowed to be extremely obsolete. (&ldquo;Do me
hangen by the hals.&rdquo; &mdash;Chaucer)</p>

<h3>We Have To Go Deeper (Glenn Willen)</h3>

<p>This puzzle originally came with almost none of the helpful markings that show
you your options for moving from one level to another &ndash; those were only in the
normal version. But testsolvers really liked the puzzle once it had them, so
the hard version got them, too. The extraction also used to be considerably
more complicated than it is now.</p>

<p>The puzzle still took many teams a bit of time, even though Glenn thought
we were turning it into the easiest puzzle in the hunt.</p>

<h3>The Futoshiki Kick (Charles)</h3>

<p>Should I admit this? I&rsquo;ll admit this. This meta was written two days before the
hunt. In fact, it was written <em>during</em> the complete testsolving run.</p>

<p>Amos had written an interesting metapuzzle that plugged every answer into a
<em>different</em> logic puzzle, so that you had to solve most of seven logic puzzles,
with a hidden twist as well, to get the answer. Once I saw how long we were
running, though, I decided quite unilaterally that the puzzle containing seven
other puzzles had to go, even though it was a metapuzzle. Sorry about that,
Amos.</p>

<p>So then we needed a metapuzzle, written really fast, that used seven answers
that already existed.  I asked Charles, and he delivered.  Fortunately, the
constraint on the answers &mdash; that they were all different lengths after you
perform puzzle-ception &mdash; was still helpful.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why the mechanism for inputting answers into the metapuzzle had to be
that messy double-crostic pyramid thing combined with a decoding table.
But despite that part, I think the puzzle worked well. And it&rsquo;s interesting
that it was a metapuzzle that tells you almost exactly what to do, and yet
preserves the essential feature that you&rsquo;re more likely to solve it as you get
more answers.</p>

<p>Incidentally, because you read the answer from the 1s through 7s in the seven
rows (the one instruction the puzzle doesn&rsquo;t give you), that makes the puzzle
possibly solvable as a drop quote when you have none of the answers. An ugly
7x7 drop quote without spaces, but it probably helps that it starts with &ldquo;THE
ANSWER&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m glad nobody solved it this way (that I know of). I think one team
might have been trying to do it, though, because they called in &ldquo;DISCOVER&rdquo;
followed by &ldquo;SUPER DISCOVER&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Round 3</h2>

<h3>Dilation (Derek Kisman)</h3>

<p>I dropped the ball on this puzzle for quite a while, letting it sit in my inbox
un-testsolved for months. A couple of weeks before the hunt, I found out that
the puzzle in my inbox was damn near impossible. But Derek managed to adjust
the difficulty until we had reasonable versions of it for both hard mode and
normal mode.</p>

<p>Apparently, many solvers knew or could infer what a GTO is. That&rsquo;s good. I
didn&rsquo;t understand that clue at all.</p>

<p>At some point in making the final copies, I got confused and thought &ldquo;exalt&rdquo;
made the obscure word UPRAISE from UPBRAIDS, instead of PRAISE. The normal
version ended up with six blanks and the hard version with seven. A silly way
for the hard version to become harder, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have tripped
anyone up.</p>

<h3>Paint by Letters (Ben Aisen)</h3>

<p>Some people liked this puzzle, and some people really, really hated it. No
knock to Ben, who got us a very flexible puzzle on short notice that I for one
enjoyed.  I happen to like convoluted liar puzzles, but I can see why it would
cause frustration: there are many opportunities to get an answer that&rsquo;s very
subtly wrong, and when you get one of those, you go to the effort of filling in
the grid and you get nothing for your effort.</p>

<p>I had to basically argue with a team over the phone about this puzzle at one
point: they were claiming that the puzzle was broken because they had a valid
solution that didn&rsquo;t give them an answer, I was trying to point out the
contradiction in their solution, and they were having trouble understanding
what I was saying because I had to convey something like &ldquo;But then &lsquo;N and C are
false&rsquo; is <em>false</em>&rdquo;, and you can&rsquo;t hear quotation marks over the phone.</p>

<p>The advantage of this puzzle was that it could be adapted to basically any
answer. (Not necessarily nicely, though. When the answer was FEDERAL AIR
MARSHALS, we had it make a phone number to call for the answer instead, but
even that ultimately required too large of a grid.)</p>

<p>As an editor, I should not have let statement A stay in the puzzle. It&rsquo;s an
instruction. If it&rsquo;s a claim that can be true or false, then you can suppose
it&rsquo;s false, and then you can&rsquo;t really say you&rsquo;ve found a contradiction because
the classical logic you would use to find a contradiction has gone poof.</p>

<p>I assume Ben&rsquo;s reasoning was that A must be true because it is implicitly true
of every logic puzzle. But if it&rsquo;s false, it&rsquo;s a non-logic puzzle. This all
gets very philosophical, but in a way the puzzle has two solutions, and one of
them is to not solve it. You don&rsquo;t normally solve a puzzle by not solving it,
but this puzzle effectively mentions the possibility right up front.</p>

<p>You might even suppose that there would be a reason for the puzzle to have no
solution &mdash; perhaps that is part of the &ldquo;puzzle-ception&rdquo; you have to perform,
or perhaps the instructions are a big red herring, hiding another puzzle within
them. The flavortext I added about paradoxes (because Arthur says &ldquo;paradox&rdquo;
repeatedly in the movie) didn&rsquo;t give people confidence that logic would apply
to the puzzle, either.</p>

<p>To change the topic, I had fun choosing the supposedly changeable letters here.
If you try to perform puzzle-ception, you get statements including &ldquo;The letters
in ETOSP are HERE&rdquo;, which I would call true, and &ldquo;This puzzle contains as many
DISAPPOINTments as a statue in Harvard Yard&rdquo;, which would hopefully clue you in
that you&rsquo;ve got the wrong puzzle.</p>

<h3>Zero Gravity (me)</h3>

<p>This was my favorite puzzle to write. I hope solvers enjoyed it too. I think I
heard from some who don&rsquo;t like cryptarithms and therefore found it infuriating;
I had it testsolved by someone who likes cryptarithms and thought it was great.</p>

<p>I had a team call about the fact that they couldn&rsquo;t distinguish the Ns and Zs
in sections 7 and 10. I replied with &ldquo;Yes, those are both Ns and Zs. I&rsquo;m
sorry.&rdquo; Then I realized I could have been misinterpreted and called back:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not actually sorry. It&rsquo;s part of the puzzle and I&rsquo;m quite happy about it,
in fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know what you meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There actually is a unique solution to the Ns and Zs, up to an arbitrary swap
of two 4s and two 2s which doesn&rsquo;t change the answer.</p>

<h3>Messing with Geometry (me)</h3>

<p>The fact that this puzzle had to be the keystone of the entire hunt was quite
terrifying, for a while.</p>

<p>I started out with the constraint that I had to make a puzzle with two
versions, whose answers are similar-looking but very different. I also knew I
wanted to have a puzzle that referred to the Inception scene where Ariadne
folds up city streets into a cube.</p>

<p>That led to this puzzle idea, which seemed like it might be too constrained to
create, but I was elated to find that the overlaps between three answer words
and geometric words &mdash; in very particular places on the cube &mdash; would lead to
the answer changes I was looking for.</p>

<p>And then began the unexpectedly harder task of writing the rest of the puzzle
in a way that was solvable. The original version of this puzzle did not even
tell people they were looking for geometric shapes; it only hinted at it in the
title. I had testsolvers who managed that, remarkably, but I also had
testsolvers who never picked up on that and just found all kinds of crazy
dictionary words. It also did not say that the words had to be non-overlapping;
I had assumed that would make itself clear when you found the right words,
of course raising the question of what happens when you find the wrong ones.</p>

<p>Originally, I also had separate &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;normal&rdquo; versions, where only the
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; version had the board surrounded by a bank of possible shapes to use.
I felt at first like that weakened the puzzle &mdash; it was essential that you
wouldn&rsquo;t use all the shapes, because there was another version of the puzzle
with different shapes, but this seemed to make it a bit too obvious that this
<em>was</em> the puzzle with another version.</p>

<p>It took me far too long to realize that the hard version of the puzzle was
broken.  The correct process of solving could get you to a state that didn&rsquo;t
spell an answer if you were unlucky.</p>

<p>One problem, pointed out to me long before by Amos, was that the cubes in
MAGNETOSPHERE (in the modified version of the puzzle) do not just spell the
word SPHERE; they also spell HEPTAGON or SEPTAGON, whichever one you think is
the name of the seven-sided shape. There was no way to rearrange MAGNETOSPHERE,
within the constraints of the puzzle, to prevent this. I hand-waved this away
by saying that no reasonable solver would prefer to take HEPTAGON over SPHERE,
and even if they did they should eventually find that PENTAGON/SPHERE uses more
cubes than HEPTAGON, and that makes it more &ldquo;answery&rdquo;. In some wibbly-wobbly
way.</p>

<p>Much later, testsolvers found that letters in ELLIPSE, CURVE, and the A from
the answer could spell SPIRAL. This was actually found by testsolvers in
Normal Mode who had the shape bank, because the shape I had originally
chosen as a &ldquo;curve&rdquo; could in fact be seen as a segment as a spiral.</p>

<p>But up until the day before BAPHL, I was still just trying to rearrange and
re-rearrange the board until I could make a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; version with no shape bank
and no red herrings. Then I had an emergency last-minute testsolver try it, and
one of the first things he said was &ldquo;Seriously? Septagon?&rdquo; The next thing he
found was SPIRAL cropping up somewhere different. So that was it for that
version of the puzzle.</p>

<p>I hastily replaced it with the more-testsolved &ldquo;normal&rdquo; version. If it made it
too clear that it was the modifiable puzzle, that was not something to be
concerned about anymore, as by then we were much more worried that too few
teams would be able to finish in 7 hours.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the normal version was the level of difficulty we should have
been aiming for in Hard Mode all along. But there wasn&rsquo;t time to write an
easier Normal Mode version. So the end result was that both normal and hard
solvers got a hard puzzle, instead of normal solvers getting a hard puzzle and
hard solvers getting a broken puzzle. At least the disaster was averted.</p>

<h2>Running BAPHL</h2>

<p>There were only about 7 of us running BAPHL on site, and I&rsquo;m extremely glad
each person was there, because I think something would have broken if we had
even one fewer.</p>

<p>30-ish teams is really an incredible turnout, and I hope BAPHL can get as many
people involved when it happens again in the spring. Our biggest advice to Team
Plugh, then, is to make sure they gather enough people who will be able to run
the hunt.</p>
