The [Unicode 7.0 draft](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/) has been released, with [thousands of new characters](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-7.0/), and it's like a Christmas present for text geeks.

There are lots of new features and new scripts, such as the ability to represent shorthand writing, characters for Linear A even though we don't know what they mean, those little leafy flourishes on wedding invitations, and even more fiddly markings for linguists to put on the text they're linguistificating about. But that's presumably not the big thing you want to hear about. The big thing that will actually get all the attention is the **merger of Wingdings and emoji**.

Every crazy character that Microsoft dreamed up in the '90s, in their Wingdings and Webdings fonts, is being given a name and a codepoint in Unicode. Apple (and presumably Google) are already planning to incorporate them into the emoji lists on their smartphones.

Getting straight to the point, you can now give someone the finger in one codepoint:
