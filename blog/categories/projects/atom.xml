<p>There are lots of text files that list the words you can use in word games like
Scrabble. (Some of them are more accurate than others.) But as far as I know,
this is the only one that you can print on 17 double-sided sheets of
letter-size paper.</p>

<p>The words in the list come from the excellent, public-domain ENABLE2K word
list, compiled by Mendel Cooper. His website is sadly defunct, but the wordlist
has become a standard for word games and puzzles.</p>

<ul>
<li>The file: <a href="/downloads/confuzzle.pdf">confuzzle.pdf</a></li>
<li>LaTeX source: <a href="/downloads/confuzzle.tex">confuzzle.tex</a></li>
<li>The source wordlist: <a href="/downloads/enable.txt">enable.txt</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Why would you want a wordlist on paper instead of a computer file? The same
reason you&rsquo;d want to play word games on a board instead of on a computer.
Sometimes, you&rsquo;d rather face the person you&rsquo;re playing against than have your
face in a laptop.</p>

<h2>How the list works</h2>

<p>The list only contains words, not their definitions. Still, given that there
are over 170,000 words in the list, it takes some effort &mdash; beyond just using a
6-point font &mdash; to fit them on 34 pages.</p>

<p>This economy of printed space is accomplished through a form of human-readable
compression. When many consecutive words in alphabetical order start with the
same letters, as they tend to do, they are grouped together like this:</p>

<pre><code>ALLOTYP- e es ic ically ies y
</code></pre>

<p>The grouping was chosen by an algorithm, not by a lexicographer, so sometimes
words are grouped in odd ways:</p>

<pre><code>NONSOL- ar id ids ution utions
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also marked the differences between ENABLE and the more well-known
standard, the Official Tournament and Club Word List 2 (OWL2). These markings
are not authoritative, because I don&rsquo;t have an electronic file of OWL2. I
compiled the differences mainly from <a href="http://www.scrabbleassociation.com/boards/dictionary/octwl2.html">this National Scrabble Association
page</a>.</p>

<p>Locating the code that chose the groupings will, unfortunately, take a bit of
hard-drive archaeology. I made the list in 2003, updated it for OWL2 in 2006,
and updated it manually in 2011 to incorporate the National Scrabble
Association&rsquo;s errata to OWL2.</p>
